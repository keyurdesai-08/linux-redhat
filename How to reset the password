A user has forgotten their password. What steps would you take to reset it in a Linux system?

Steps:
1. Boot into Rescue Mode:
When booting the system, press the "e" key at the GRUB menu to edit the boot options. 
Navigate to the "linux" line and add "rescue" to the end, then press "Ctrl+x" to boot into rescue mode. 

2. Mount the Root Filesystem:
Once in rescue mode, you'll be presented with a shell prompt as root. 
Identify the correct partition where your root filesystem is located (usually /dev/sda1 or similar) and mount it read-write using the command:

Command:     mount -o remount,rw /dev/sda1 /mnt

1. Change Root Directory:
Access the mounted filesystem using the chroot command:

Command:     chroot /mnt

1.Reset the Password:
Use the passwd command to set a new password for the user: 

Command:   passwd username

1.Unmount and Reboot:
Exit the chroot environment:

Command :     exit

1.Unmount the root filesystem.

Command :     umount /mnt

1.Reboot the system.
Command : reboot
